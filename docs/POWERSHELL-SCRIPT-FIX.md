# Fixed: PowerShell Script Encoding Error

## Issue

```
At E:\EASM_Document\7.Python\easm-rnd\skaffold.ps1:67 char:51
The string is missing the terminator: '.
ParserError: TerminatorExpectedAtEndOfString
```

## Root Cause

Unicode arrow character `→` and emoji `🔌` were causing PowerShell parsing errors.

## Solution Applied

### Changed From:

```powershell
Write-Host "🔌 Port Forwarding Configuration:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   API:        localhost:$apiPort → container:8000" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   PostgreSQL: localhost:$postgresPort → container:5432" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   Redis:      localhost:$redisPort → container:6379" -ForegroundColor White
```

### Changed To:

```powershell
Write-Host "Port Forwarding Configuration:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   API:        localhost:$apiPort -> container:8000" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   PostgreSQL: localhost:$postgresPort -> container:5432" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   Redis:      localhost:$redisPort -> container:6379" -ForegroundColor White
```

**Changes:**

- ❌ Removed emoji `🔌`
- ❌ Replaced Unicode arrow `→` with ASCII arrow `->`
- ✅ Now uses only ASCII characters

## How to Run the Script

### Method 1: Bypass Execution Policy (One-time)

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\skaffold.ps1
```

### Method 2: Set Execution Policy (Permanent)

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator, then:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Then you can run normally:
.\skaffold.ps1
```

### Method 3: Unblock the File

```powershell
Unblock-File .\skaffold.ps1
.\skaffold.ps1
```

## Test Result

After the fix, the script runs successfully:

```
PS> powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\skaffold.ps1
=== EASM Skaffold Deployment Script ===

[*] Loading environment variables from skaffold.env...
  [+] Set DEBUG
  [+] Set SECRET_KEY
  ... (all variables loaded)

[OK] Kubernetes cluster is running

[*] Updating Helm repositories...
Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈

Port Forwarding Configuration:
   API:        localhost:8000 -> container:8000
   PostgreSQL: localhost:5432 -> container:5432
   Redis:      localhost:6379 -> container:6379

Choose deployment mode:
  1) Development (skaffold dev - with hot reload)
  2) One-time deployment (skaffold run)
  3) Development profile (no persistence)
  4) Production profile (with persistence and scaling)

Enter your choice (1-4):
```

✅ **Script is now working!**

## Files Fixed

1. ✅ `skaffold.ps1` - Removed Unicode characters
2. ✅ `skaffold.sh` - Updated for consistency (uses same ASCII arrow)
3. ✅ `README.md` - Added execution policy instructions

## Recommendation

**Use Method 1** (bypass) for quick testing, or **Method 2** (set policy) for permanent solution.

```powershell
# Quick run:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\skaffold.ps1
```

This is the safest and easiest way to run the script without changing system settings.
